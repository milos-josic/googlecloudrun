# which is an unprivileged user that comes built into all of the official node images from Docker.
# Without this line, they would run as root, which is against security best practices and in particular the principle of least privilege. Many Docker tutorials skip this step for simplicity, 
# and we will have to do some extra work to avoid running as root, but I think itâ€™s very important.
